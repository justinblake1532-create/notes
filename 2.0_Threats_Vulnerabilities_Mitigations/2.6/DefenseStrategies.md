# Defense Strategies

### Layering
 : Uses multiple, overlapping security controls (physical, administrative, technical), to protect against threats by creating <ins>redudant</ins> layers of defense


### Principle of Least Privilege
 : a user, program, or system should only have the minimum permissions and access necessary to perform its required functions, <ins>nothing more</ins>


### Variety
 : A security program should use multiple, dissimilar types of security controls
- Cont.
    * What you know -> User/Password
    * What you are -> Biometrics
    * What you have -> ID Card
    * Where you are -> Geolocation
        - Example: 
            * Multi-Factor Authentication


### Randomness
 : intentionally introduces unpredictability into a system to make it more difficult for attackers to exploit vulnerabilities


### implicity
 : Secuirty systems should be as straight forward and uncomplicated as possible
