# ApplicationAttacks

Injection
 : When an attacker inserts malicious code or commands into an apps input to execute unauthorized actions, gain access to sensitive data, or compromise the system
Buffer Overflow
 : Attacker sends more data to programs buffer than it's designed to handle
Replay
 : Attack involves capturing a legit data transmission, such as an auth request or command, and then retransmitting it later to gain unauthorized access
Privilege Escalation
 : Attacker exploits a vulerability in a app or OS to gain higher-level access than they were originally granted
Forgery 
 : Refers to Cross-Site Request Forgery(CSRF) and Server-Site Request Forgery(SSRF). Tricks a user's browser into seding unwanted HTTP requests to a trusted application, exploiting authenticated sessions(CSRF). SSRF abuses an applications server functionality to make requests to internal or external resources, often to steal data or gain unauthorized access
Directory Traversal
 : Attack where attacker(s) manipulates user input to access files and directories on the server outside the web root folder
