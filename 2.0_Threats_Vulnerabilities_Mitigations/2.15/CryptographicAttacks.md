# Cryptographic Attacks

### Downgrade
 : Forces a system to abandon a stronger security protocol for a weaker, older, or less secure one, effectively lowering its security to expose and manipulate data


### Collision
 : Exploits a weakness in hashing algorithms where two different inputs produce the exact same hash value


### Birthday
 : An exploit that uses mathematics of the birthday paradox to find a <ins>collision</ins> in a hash function
