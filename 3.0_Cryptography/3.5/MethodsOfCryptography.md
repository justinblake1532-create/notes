# Methods of Cryptography


### Elliptic Curve Cryptography(ECC)
 : Generates smaller keys with greater levels of security, securing connections and data transmissions


### Perfect Forward Secrecy
 : Each message is encrypted with a **unique** key. Also can be called <ins>Ephemeral Key</ins>


### Obscurity
 : Making data difficult to find
- Example:
    * Data Masking
    * Stegonography
    * Tokenization


### Data Masking 
: Taking data and replacing the characters with an alternate character
- Example:
    * Replacing the characters in the data with "x"
