# Active Reconaissance


## Active Reconaissance
 : Gathering information through proactive probing and interacting with the target
 * The target can become aware of the recon due to the "noise" made



# Methods of Active Reconaissance


## Port Scanning
 : Scanning a target network to find vulnerable netowrk ports to exploit


## Service Enumeration
 : Interacting with identified services to find more detailed information


## OS Fingerprinting
 : Identifying the OS running on the target system(s)


## DNS Enumeration
: Gathering detailed information about the target's DNS infrastructure(domain names, subdomains, IP addresses)


## Web Application Crawling
 : Browsing public sites from the target to find any vulnerabilities



# Methods of Implementing Physical Securituy through Environment


## - Barricade(Entry/Exit Points)
## - Fencing
## - Lighting
## - Bollards
## - Warning Signs
## - Sensors
## - Gateway/Locks
## - Access Badges
## - Security Guards
## - Security Cameras
## - Alarm Systems


# Methods of Passive Reconaissance


## Packet Sniffing
 : Capturing data packets during a data transmission


## Eavesdropping
 : Covertly listening on a communication


## Open-Source Intelligence(OSINT)
 : Gathering data from public sources


## Network Traffic Analysis
 : Monitoring network traffic to identify patterns and other important data



# Network Monitoring Tools


## Ping
 : Tests a connection between two computing devices through sending ICMP packets to each other


## tracert/traceroute
 : Shows the paths the netowrk packet takes to reach its destination


## pathping
 : Combines the ping and tracert commands; locates netowrk devices that are down and/or have latency issues


## netstat
 : Displays network statistics about the system and/or the network


## route
 : Displays the routing table and can make changes to the routing table


## arp 
 : Matches IP addresses to its corressponding MAC address


## nslookup/dig
 : Used to view and modify DNS settings; can provide IP info and domain names


## ipconfig/ifconfig
 : Displays the IP configuration of a system


## hping
 : A security tool to check the connectivity of the target system,


## netcat
 : A tool to read and write datat across TCP and UDP network connections



# Reconaissance Tools


## * OSINT
## * theHarvester
 : Passive recon tool to gather information on a target from public resources(emails, names, subdomains, IP addresses, etc.)
## * Shodan
 : A search engine that can query information on targets to see if there are any known vulnerabilities with that target
## * Dnsenum
 : A program that can search for DNS related information(usernames, system names, IP addresses, etc.)
## curl and wget
 : Command-Line tools to download and upload files
 - Download and entire website
## Scanless
 : Users exploitation websites to perform port scans rather than a traditional port scanner
## Sn1per 
 : An automated scanner to enumerate and scan for vulnerablilites; can find DNS information, open ports, running services, etc.
## Nessus
 : A proprietary vulerability scanner to scan a network for vulnerabilities



# Reconaissance


## Reconaissance
 : The process of gathering information


## Passive Reconnaissance
 : Gathering information on a target with no direct interaction with the target
 * Gathering evidence/information without altering the target



# Types of Physical Attacks


## - Brute-Force
## - Environmental(Cutting power lines, disrupting cooling systems)
## - RFID Cloning
 : Creating a copy of existing RFID badge



# Types of Sensors


## Infrared
 : Detects changes in heat patterns from moving objects


## Pressure
 : Installed inside of floors or mats and triggered when stepped on


## Microwave
 : Emits microwave pulses and measures the reflections off a moving object


## Ultrasonic
 : Emits sound waves at frequencies above human hearing; measures time it takes for waves to return after hitting an object
