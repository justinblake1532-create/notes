# Agile Development Life Cycle


## Agile Development Life Cycle
 : A model the focuses on continuous changes divided into small timeframes
 * Development cycles are known as <ins>sprints</ins>

### 1. Requirements

### 2. Design

### 3. Develop

### 4. Testing

### 5. Deployment

### 6. Start Next Spring (go back to step 1)
# Application Hardening Techniques


## * Block Process Spawning
## * Control Access to Executable Files
## * Protect the OS Components
## * Use Exception Rules; allows admin to bypass hardening rules
## * Data Execution Prevention


# Coding Errors


## Compile
 : An error that occurs during the building or compilation stage; prevents applications from running


## Runtime
 : An error that occurs when the application is running


## Exceptions
 : How an application responds to unexpected errors that can lead to holes in teh security of the application
 * Exceptions must be controlled <ins>well</ins> in the application


## Static Code Analysis(SCA) 
 : Scrutinizing soure code to identify potential vulnerabilities, errors, and non-compliant coding practices before the program is finalized



# Secure Coding Techniques


## Normalization
 : Data recognized in a relational database with the intent to elimainate redundancy by having all related data stored in one place


## Stored Procedures
 : One or more datatbase statements stored as a group in a database's data dictionary


## Code Obfuscation
 : Creating source or machine code that is difficult for humans to read


## Code Reuse
 : Using the same code multiple times 


## Dead Code
 : Source code in a program that is executed but is not used in any other computation


## Memory Management
 : Assigning portions of memory into blocks to various running programs that optimizde overall system performance


## Software Development Kits(SDKs)
 : A set of software development tools that can be installed as one unit


## Sensitive Data Exposure
 : Unintended exposure of personal and confindential data


## Fuzz Testing
 : A software testing technique that exposes security problems by providing invalid, unexpected, or random data to the inputs of the application


## Code Signing
 : A method of using a digital signature to ensure the source and integrity of programming code


## Cookies
 : Small pieces of data stored on a computer by a web browser while accessing a website



# Secure Testing Methods


## Static Application Security Testing
 : Focuses on finding coding errors early in the development lifecycle


## Dynamic Application Security Testing
 : Focuses on finding coding errors after the development has concluded


## Interactive Application Security Testing
### * Passive
 : Scans an application while its currently running
### * Active
 : Tools that can interact with the code and the coding software to identify problematic code


## Sandboxing
 : A security mechanism used in software development and operation to isolate running processes from each other



# Waterfall Development Life Cycle


## 1. Requirements
 : All requirements for the application being developed are gathered from the client, user, or stakeholder

## 2. Design
 : The software is documented, diagramed, and designed

## 3. Implementation
 : The code is written

## 4. Testing
 : A quality assurance team makes sure the requriements are met; the code works properly accross all devices, and security issues are noted

## 5. Deployment
 : The application is released to a client or the publice

## 6. Maintenance
 : The application is monitored for bugs or problems that are patched or fixed while in use
