# Secure Testing Methods


## Static Application Security Testing
 : Focuses on finding coding errors early in the development lifecycle


## Dynamic Application Security Testing
 : Focuses on finding coding errors after the development has concluded


## Interactive Application Security Testing
### * Passive
 : Scans an application while its currently running
### * Active
 : Tools that can interact with the code and the coding software to identify problematic code


## Sandboxing
 : A security mechanism used in software development and operation to isolate running processes from each other
