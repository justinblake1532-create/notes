# Implmenting IDS/IPS


## Host-Based
 : A program installed on the host system itself which monitors all traffic going to the host system
* Ex: Anti-Malware Software


## Network-Based
 : A dedicated device installed on a network and analyzed all network traffic in real-time



# Intrusion Prevention System


## Intrusion Prevention System(IPS)
 : An active security control that monitors and logs network activity; when it detects a security breach, it takes action to stop adn prevent the attack



# Intrusion Detection System


## Intrusion Detection System(IDS)
 : Passive security control that monitors and logs network activity; detects security breaches but doesn't stop or prevent them



# Methods of Detecting Malware/Unauthorized Traffic


## Signature-Based
 : Looks for patterns in network traffic and compares them to known attack patterns


## Heuristic-Based
 : A method where an initial outline of normal network traffic is provided to a system and goes on to monitor the network based on the provided outline



# States of Network Traffic


## Positive
 : The system detected an attack, the appropriate alarms and notifications were generated, or the correct actions were performed to prevent or stop the attack


## False Positive
 : The system identified harmless traffic as offensive and generated an alrm or stopped the traffic


## Negative
 : The system deemed the traffic harmless and let it pass


## False Negative
 : Harmful traffic was allowed to pass without any alerts being generated or any actions being taken to prevent or stop it



# Trend Analysis


## Trend Analysis
 : A procedure which aims to understand an environment for a long period of time through identifying patterns, anomalies, and potential threats
 * Keep track of current trends in the IT landscape
 * Updated record of known threats
 * Able to view open-source resources or obtain proprietary resources
