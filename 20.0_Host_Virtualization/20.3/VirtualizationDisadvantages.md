# Virtualization Disadvantages


## * Attacks targeting the host physical system could compromise all of the VMs on that host machine

## * Any failures on the host system could also affect the VMs running on the host system

## * Implementing multiple VMs can be a complex process

## * VM Escape
 : An attack where a threat actor gains access to a VM and is able to break out of that environment and into the host system
