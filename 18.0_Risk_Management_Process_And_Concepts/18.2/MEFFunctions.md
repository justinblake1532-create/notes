# MEF Functions


## Maximum Tolerable Downtime(MTD)
 : The longest period of time that a business function outage may occur for without causing irrecoverable business failure

## Recovery Time Objective(RTO)
 : The period following a disaster that an individual IT system may remain offline

## Work Recovery Time(WRT)
 : Additional work when reintegrating systems and testing restored/upgraded systems following an incident

## Recovery Point Objective(RPO)
: The longest period of time that an organization can tolerate data being unrecoverable

## Mean Time Before Failures(MTBF)
 : The expected lifetime of a product

## Mean Time to Repair(MTTR)
: The measure of the time taken to correct a fault so the system is restored to full operation

## Risk Identification
 : The process of recognizing different types of threats and documenting them

## Risk Mitigation
 : The overall process of reducing exposure to or the effects of risk factors

## Risk Deterrence
 : The reponse of deploying security controls to reduce the likelihood and/or impace of a threat scenario

## Avoidance
 : The practice of ceasing an activity that presents risk

## Risk Transferrence
 : Assigning third-party organizations risks so that the primary business doesn't have to deal with those same risks

## Risk Acceptance
: No countermeaures are put into place because the level of risk does not justify it

## Risk Exception
 : A risk that can't be mitigated using standard risk management practices or within a specified time frame due to specific conditions

## Residual Risk
 : The liklihood an impact after specific mitigation, transferrence, or acceptance measures have been applied

## Risk Exemption
 : A condition where risk can remain without mitigation, usually due to a strategic business decision



## - <ins>Risk Management Process Variables</ins>

### * Likelihood
 : The chance of an event that is expressed as a subjectively-determined scale; used in <ins>QUALITATIVE</ins> risk analysis
### * Probablility
 : The chance of an event that is expressed as a precentage; used in a <ins>QUALITATIVE</ins> risk analysis
### * Impact
 : The security of the risk if realized by factors such as the scope, value of the asset, or the financial impacts of the event


## Risk Assesments
 : The process of identifying risks, analyzing them, developing a response strategy for them, and mitigating their future impact


## - <ins>Types of Risk Assesments</ins>

### * Ad Hoc
 : Conducted as needed, generally in respose to specific incidents
### * Recurring
 : Assessments schedules at regular intervals
### * One-Time
 : Comprehensive evaluations carried out for an important process
### * Continuous
 : Assessments that constantly evaluate risk using specialized tools


## Risk Analysis
 : The process of qualifying or quantifying the likelihood and impact of a factor

## Quantitative Risk Analysis
 : A numerical method that is used to access the probability and impact of risk and measure the impact

## Single Loss Expectancy(SLE)
 : The amount that would be lost in a single occurrence of a risk factor
 * Formula: Value of Asset * Exposure Factor (EF)

## Authorized Loss Expectancy(ALE)
 : The amount that would be lost ober the course of a year
 * Formula: SLE * ALO

## Annualized Loss Rate of Occurance(ALO)
: The number of times in a year that an event occurs


## Qualitative Risk Analysis
 : The process of determining the probability of occurrence and the impact of identified risks by using logical reasoning when numeric data is not readily available

## Inherent Risk
 : Risk that an event will pose if no controls are put into place to mitigate it
 * The results of quantitative or qualitative risk assessment

## Risk Register
 : A document showing the results of risk assessments in a comprehensive formal; includes information about the risks involved, their severity, the owner of the risk, and all mitigation strategies

## Risk Owner
 : The individual responsible for managing a risk, identifying a risk, mitigating the risk, and all other actions related to the risk

## Risk Appetite
 : The level of risk that an organization is willing to accept


## - <ins>Levels of Risk Appetite</ins>

### * Expansionary
 : Organizations are willing to take higher levels of risk for greater returns
### * Conservative
 : Organizations prioritize risk avoidance to maintain their assets and resources
### * Neutral
 : Organizations will take risks that align with their objectives and manage all risks taken into consideration


## Risk Reporting
 : The methods used to communicate an organizations risk profile and the effectiveness of its risk management program

## Business Continuity Plan(BCP)
 : A procedure that identifies appropriate disaster responses that maintain business operations during reduced infrastructure/resource capabilities

## Continuity of Operations(COOP)
 : The process of ensuring that an organization can maintain or quickly resume its critical functions in the event of a disruption, disaster, or crisis

## Backups
 : Copies of data that are stored in an external locations

## Capacity Planning
 : A practice which involves estimating the personnel, storage, computer hardware, software, and connection infrastructure resources required over some future period of time


## -<ins>Different Types of Site</ins>

### * Hot Site
 : A fully configured alternate processing site that can be brought online either instantly or very quickly after a disaster; most costly option
### * Warm Site
 : A prcoessing site that is dormant and performs noncritical functions under normal conditions, but which can be rapidly converted to a key operations site if needed
### * Cold Site
 : A predetermined alternate location where a network can be rebuilt after a disaster


## Tabletop Excersises
 : A discussion of simulated emergency situations and security incidents

## Simulation
 : A software program that generates many simulated, likely outcomes for real-world process
