# Methods of Malicious Code


## Shellcode
 : Simple programs designed to exploid vulnerabilities for an app/service


## Credential Dumping
 : A form of malware that attempts to access credentials held in system's memory


## Lateral/Escalated Movement
# Types of DNS Attacks


## DNS-Based On-Path Attack
 : An attack where a threat actor uses ARM poisoning to respond to DNA queries from target system with spoofed replies


## DNS Client Cache Poisoning
 : An attack to corrupt the DNS records for a device


## DNS Server Cache Poisoning
 : An attack to corrupt the DNS records for an entire network



# Types of Network Attacks


## Credential Harvesting
 : A type of reconaissance to learn passwords or cyrptographic secrets to obtain authenticated access to network systems


## Denial of Service(DoS)
 : An attack that causes a host system or service to become unavailable


## Weaponization, Delivery, and Breach
 : Attacks that allow threat actors to gain unauthorized access without having to authenticate; using malicious code to exploid vulnerabilites in services


## Command and Control(C&C)
 : Using malicious code to compromise a remote host and maintain access to it for a long period of time


## Reflected Attack
 : Spoofing the targets IP addresses and attempts to make network connections with third-party devices


## Amplified Attack
 : An attack that targets weaknesses in applications protocols to consume more of the target's bandwidth


## On-Path Attack
 : An attack where a threat actor gains access to a network connection and discretely monitors the connection


## Address Resolution Protocol(ARP) Poisioning
 : An attack that sends false ARP packets over a network to link the threat actors MAC address to a legitimate network's IP address



# Types of Shell Programs


## Powershell
 : A framework designed to replace CMD through more options and controls; able to create simple scripts to perform automated tasks


## Bash
 : A scripting language that works in the background to execute commands that can run on the entire system
