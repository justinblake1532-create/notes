# OSI Model Layers


## Physical Layer
 : the physical networking equipment involved with the data transfers; data is converted into <ins>bits</ins> (0's and 1's)


## Data Link Layer
 : Fascilitates data transfers between <ins>two</ins> devices into smaller pieces called frames


## Network Layer
 : Decides the path that the data will take when transporting data


## Transport Layer
 : Ensures data is being sent to other systems, the actual communication itself using protocols; breaks up data into segments to send to layer 3 (TCP,UDP)


## Session Layer
 : Responsible for maintaining a network session between two or more systems (data transmission)


## Application Layer
 : Reposible for protocols and data manipulation that software uses to present data to the user; web browsers, email clients; only layer that interacts with input data from user (SMTP,FTP)
