# Types of Firewalls


## Host-Based Firewall
 : Inspects network traffic received by an individual system; generally seen as software implementation


## Network-Based Firewall
 : Inspects incoming and outgoing network traffic on a network; generally seen as a hardware implementation


## Web Application Firewall
 : Helps to protect application/services running on web servers and databases; enforces rules to filter and inspect traffic


## Next Generation Firewall
 : A more advanced firewall with more features(intrusion prevention, malware detection) for more in-depth network analysis


## UTM


## Stateless Firewall
 : A firewall that doesn't preserve information about network sessions; packets are analyzed individually


## Layer 4 Firewall
 : A firewall that examlines the TCP-handshake to distinguish new connections from established ones; block specific IP addresses


## Layer 7 Firewall
 : A firewall that inspects packet headers and their payload in full; reassembles entire messages and stops each packet for inspection
