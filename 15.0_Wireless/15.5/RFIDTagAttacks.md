# RFID Tag Attacks


## RFID Tags
 : Small circuit boards that use radio waves to transmit data


## - Types of RFID Tags


### * Active RFID Tag
 : Use onboard batteries and can send signals over a long distance (ex: road toll pass)
### * Passive RFID Tags
 : Are not powered and relies on the energy of the scanner to transmit data (ex: ID badges, credit cards, etc.)
### * Near Field Communication(NFC)
 : A more secure version of RFID; allows for two way commmunication between devices within a few centimeters of each other
