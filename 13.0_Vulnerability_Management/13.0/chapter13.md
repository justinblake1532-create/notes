# Data Loss Prevention (DLP) Components


## Policy Servers
 : Systems that configure classification rules and policies to compile reports to be ledgible by end-users


## Endpoint Agents
 : Client computers


## Network Agents
 : Systems that scan parts of the network interfaces to enforce policies



# Methods to Run Vulbnerability Scan


## Intrusive
 : Finding a vulnerability and actively attempting to exploit the service; provides more accurate results, but can't be done on a <ins>live system</ins>


## Non-Intrusive
 : Scanning the network and lists all the potential vulnerabilities, but cannot validate if the system if vulerable


## Credentialed
 : User account with login rights to various hosts, plus whatever other permissions are appropriate for the testing routines


## Non-Credentialed
 : The process of directing test packets at a host without being logged onto the OS or application



# Network Monitoring Tools


## Network Monitors
 : Dedicated pieces of hardware/software to collect data on devices that are sending and receiving data on a network


## Netflow
 : A means of recording metadata and statistics about network traffic
 * Highlighting trends in netowrk traffic, alerting when anomalies occur, identifying components in netowrk traffic, etc.


## System Logs
 : An audit trail that documents what a user/system did while they were using IT resources/services


## Application/Cloud Monitors
 : A software solution that actively scans a digital environment to uncover any vulnerabilities or unwanted activity 


## Vulnerability Scanners


## Anti-Virus/Anit-Malware


## Data Loss Prevention (DLP)
 : An ongoing process of mediating specific data to restict unauthorized access to IT resources; detect and prevent leakage of sensitive data


## Security Information and Event Management(SIEM)
 : A tool that collects data from network sensors and system logs
 * Main advantage is the consolodation of multiple activities into a single interface
 * Able to send reports based on alerts and status updates
 * Can archive datat for a defined period to use for future use



# Penetration Life Cycle


## 1. Reconaissance
## 2. Scanning/Enumeration
## 3. Gaining Access
## 4. Maintaining Access
## 5. Reporting
# Penetration Testing


## Penetration Testing
 : The authorized simulation of an attack against an organization's security infrastructure



# Penetration Testing Documents/Contracts


## Scope of Work
 : A very detailed document that defines exactly what is going to be included in the penetration test
 * Answer's the "who, what, when, where, and why" of the penetration test


## Rules of Engagement
 : A document defines exaclty how the penetration test will be carried out



# Primary SIEM Sources


## Agents
 : Dedicated software installed on individual systems to extract data off of


## Listener/Controller
 : Configuring individual systems to send out their recent configurations changes to a SIEM server


## Sensors
 : Collecting data traffic from packet sniffers



# Remediation Mechanisms in DLP


## Alert-Only
 : Copying data is allowed, but the DLP system records the incident and can alert an administrator


## Block
 : The user is prevented from copying a file but still has access to it; the incident is logges regardless if it's legitimate or not


## Quarantine
 : Access to a file is denied to the end-user


## Tombstone
 : Access to a file is no longer available and replaced by a policy violation alert



# Types of Penetration Testing


## Known Environment/White-Hat Testing
 : The penetration tester is given full knowledge of the target or network


## Unknown Environment/Black-Hat Testing
 : The penetration tester has no information regarding the target of netowrk, such as IP configurations, emails lists, etc.


## Bug Bounties



# Types of Security Teams


## Red Team
 : Ehtical hackers; responsible for performing the penetration test


## Blue Team
 : IT security analysts; responsible for stopping the red team's advances


## Purple Team
 : Members who work on both offense and defense measures


## White Team
 : The referees of the practice session; responsible for managing the red and blue teams activities



# Types of Threat Feeds


## Third-Party Threat Feeds
 : Organization's that compile largs amounts of data and provide that information for public use or profit
 * Open-source or proprietary threat feed


## Open-Source Intelligence(OSINT)
 : Publicly available information about current trends in the IT landscape(Shodan, theHarvester, etc.)


## Information-Sharing Organizations
 : Collaborative gorups that exchange data about emerging cybersecurity threats and vulnerabilities
 * Common members include businesses, government entities, academic institutions


## Deep/Dark Web
 : Parts of the World Wide Web that are not normally indexed using a common search engine; holds private/anonymous information



# Vulnerability Analysis Considerations


## Prioritization
 : Organizing the vulnerabilities by how critical they are to damage IT assets


## Classification
 : Categorizing vulnerabilities based on their characteristics


## Exposure Factor
 : The extent to which an asset is susceptible to being compromised/impacted by a specific vulnerability
 

## Impact
 : The negatice side effects of a successful cyberattack(financial loss, reputational damage, penalties, etc.)


## Environmental Factors
 : Variables that can influence analysis based on the types of attacks are targeted


## Risk Tolerance
 : The level of risk an organization is willing to accept


## Vulnerability Validation
 : Ensures that the remediation process has been successfully implemented and functions as intended


## Vulnerability Reporting
 : The process of an entity/organization documenting any findings they have pertaining to vulberablilites and sending that data to a trusted third-party



# Vulnerability Identification Methods


## * Penetration Testing
## * Bug Bounties
 : A form of finding vulnerabilites through opening the testing process to global communities
## * Auditing
 : Assessing an organization's security controls and policies to determine if the organization's are meeting the required standards



# Vulnerability Management


## Vulnerability Management
 : An organizations strategy ecompassing all of their IT assets/resources for the purpose of identifying exploits, evaluating the best course of action, and further harden security infrastructure


## End-Of-Life(EOL)
 : A product from a manufacturer/vendor that no longer receives updates or any new security patches


## Legacy
 : Older systems/services that serve a critical purpose in an organiztions IT infrastructure



# Vulnerability Scanning


## Vulnerability Scanning
 : A process to identify and evaluate potential issues within iT systems
 * Regular scanning should be performed to maintain proper security posture


## Threat Feeds
 : A database that aggregates data from a variety of sources(cybersecurity firms, vendors, online communities, governments)
* Threat feeds are used to stay up-to-date withing current IT landscape
* Common threat feeds include Open Threat Exchange(OTx), X-Force Exchange, and Recorded Future
