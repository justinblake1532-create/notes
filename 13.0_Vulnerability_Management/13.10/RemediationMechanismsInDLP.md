# Remediation Mechanisms in DLP


## Alert-Only
 : Copying data is allowed, but the DLP system records the incident and can alert an administrator


## Block
 : The user is prevented from copying a file but still has access to it; the incident is logges regardless if it's legitimate or not


## Quarantine
 : Access to a file is denied to the end-user


## Tombstone
 : Access to a file is no longer available and replaced by a policy violation alert
