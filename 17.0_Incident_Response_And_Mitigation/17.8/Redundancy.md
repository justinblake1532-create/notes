# Redundancy


## Redundancy
 : A method for providing fault tolerance by using duplicate or multiple components that perform the same function

## Fault Tolerance
 : The ability to respond to an unexpected hardware or software failure without loss of data or loss of operation


## - <ins>Methods for Implementing Secure Networks</ins>

### * Load Balancing
 : A process that distributes processing amoung multiple nodes

### * Active/active
 : Two load balancers working in tandum to distribute network traffic

### * Active/passive
 : Two load balancers with one actively working and the second one listening mode to take over if the first becomes unavailable

### * Power Scheduling
 : Used to configure an active redundancy by sending power to networks when a power fascility goes down; helps prevent total power loss

### * Virtual IP(VIP)
: An IP addresss that isnt't assigned to a signle system; can be assigned to multiple systems

### * Geographical Dispersal
 : The use of multiple locations to store data to mitigate downtime due to location

### * Multipath
 : A fault-tolerance technique that gives multiple physical paths between a CPU and a mass-storage appliance

### * Uninterrupted Power Supply(UPS)
 : A stand-alone bank of batteries that allows for the gracedful shutdown of network appliances when the power goes out

### * Generator
 : A large scale device that provides power for an extended period of time

### * Dual Supply
 : A power device that allows for one power unit to fail and for the other power supply to replace it; able to hot-swap power supplies

### * Managed Power Distribution Unit(PDU)
 : A rack-mounted unit that ditributes power on a large scale as a data center
